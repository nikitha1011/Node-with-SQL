User Management System

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and EJS.
It allows users to:

Create new user accounts with a username, email, and password

Read and view all registered users

Update existing user information securely

Delete users permanently with password verification

The application uses UUID for unique user IDs, MySQL for database management, and method-override to handle HTTP methods like PATCH and DELETE.
It‚Äôs a beginner-friendly full-stack project designed to help understand how CRUD operations work with database integration in a dynamic web application.
